Currently there is no licensing attached to this package since I'm still investigating the best possible license
to support it. I'm looking for one that is open and allows free distribution and re-use of the package.
Yet still keep it as something that could be expanded upon by and for the open community.
In short, something that says: "We all benefit!"
